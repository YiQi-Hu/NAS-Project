Old version of HW NAS

The data directory is renamed from 'cifar-10-batches-bin/' to 'data/' for the universality.
The evaluation code is renamed as 'evaluator.py' instead of 'evaluater.py' for the correctness in spelling.

'dis_nas.py' is the distributed version of 'nas.py', and its correctness has been proved in Huawei.
